# BANK LOAN REPORT ANALYSIS USING TABLEAU


"In this project, I developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report using Tableau Public, structured across three distinct dashboards—Summary, Overview, and Details. Each dashboard serves a specific purpose in analyzing and visualizing key loan-related metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making and performance monitoring.
## Summary Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the bank's loan performance by leveraging key performance indicators (KPIs). The main objective is to track and analyze various aspects of the bank's loan portfolio over time.

**Details:**  
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
  - **Total Loan Applications:** The total number of loan applications received.
  - **Total Funded Amount:** The total amount of money disbursed for loans.
  - **Total Amount Received:** The total amount of money collected from loan repayments.
  - **Average Interest Rate:** The average interest rate applied to the loans.
  - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** A metric that assesses the borrower’s ability to manage monthly debt payments and repay loans.

- **Performance Segmentation:**
  - **Month-to-Date (MTD):** The KPIs are segmented by Month-to-Date metrics, allowing for real-time tracking of the bank's loan performance.
  - **Month-over-Month (MoM):** The dashboard includes Month-over-Month comparisons to analyze trends and changes in performance over time.

- **Loan Categorization:**
  - **Good Loans:** Loans that are either fully paid or current, reflecting positive loan quality.
  - **Bad Loans:** Loans that have been charged off, indicating potential losses and areas for improvement in loan quality.

This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the bank's loan performance, identifying trends, and making informed decisions to optimize financial outcomes.

## Overview Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
The Overview Dashboard visually represents critical loan metrics and trends using a variety of chart types, providing a detailed look at lending activities from multiple angles.

**Key Charts:**

- **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):**
  - **Details:** This line chart tracks Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received over time, with the X-axis representing months and the Y-axis showing metric values.
  - **Insights:** It reveals seasonal patterns and long-term trends, allowing the bank to understand fluctuations in lending activity and adjust strategies accordingly.

- **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):**
  - **Details:** This map is color-coded by state, showing lending metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received across different regions.
  - **Insights:** It highlights regional disparities, helping the bank identify high-performing areas and potential markets for expansion.

- **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):**
  - **Details:** The donut chart segments loans by term length (e.g., 36 months, 60 months), with each segment representing the proportion of Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.
  - **Insights:** This chart provides insights into borrower preferences for loan terms, which can inform the bank’s product offerings.

- **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):**
  - **Details:** This bar chart displays lending metrics based on borrowers' employment length categories, such as 1 year, 5 years, and 10+ years.
  - **Insights:** It helps the bank understand how employment stability influences loan applications and repayments.

- **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):**
  - **Details:** The bar chart categorizes loans by their stated purposes, such as debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.
  - **Insights:** It shows the primary reasons borrowers seek loans, aiding in targeted marketing and product development.

- **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):**
  - **Details:** This tree map categorizes loans by home ownership status (e.g., own, rent, mortgage), with each segment’s size reflecting lending metrics.
  - **Insights:** It helps in understanding the relationship between home ownership and borrowing behavior, which can be useful for risk assessment and product segmentation.

## Details Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
The Details Dashboard serves as a comprehensive view of all essential loan data, allowing users to access critical information efficiently.

**Details:**  
- It includes a grid view categorized by loan status, showing metrics such as:
  - **Total Loan Applications**
  - **Funded Amounts**
  - **Amounts Received**
  - **Month-to-Date (MTD) metrics**

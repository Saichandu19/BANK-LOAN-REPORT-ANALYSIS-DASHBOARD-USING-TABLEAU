# BANK LOAN REPORT ANALYSIS USING TABLEAU


"In this project, I developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report using Tableau Public, structured across three distinct dashboards—Summary, Overview, and Details. Each dashboard serves a specific purpose in analyzing and visualizing key loan-related metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making and performance monitoring.
## Summary Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the bank's loan performance by leveraging key performance indicators (KPIs). The main objective is to track and analyze various aspects of the bank's loan portfolio over time.

**Details:**  
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
  - **Total Loan Applications:** The total number of loan applications received.
  - **Total Funded Amount:** The total amount of money disbursed for loans.
  - **Total Amount Received:** The total amount of money collected from loan repayments.
  - **Average Interest Rate:** The average interest rate applied to the loans.
  - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** A metric that assesses the borrower’s ability to manage monthly debt payments and repay loans.

- **Performance Segmentation:**
  - **Month-to-Date (MTD):** The KPIs are segmented by Month-to-Date metrics, allowing for real-time tracking of the bank's loan performance.
  - **Month-over-Month (MoM):** The dashboard includes Month-over-Month comparisons to analyze trends and changes in performance over time.

- **Loan Categorization:**
  - **Good Loans:** Loans that are either fully paid or current, reflecting positive loan quality.
  - **Bad Loans:** Loans that have been charged off, indicating potential losses and areas for improvement in loan quality.

This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the bank's loan performance, identifying trends, and making informed decisions to optimize financial outcomes.

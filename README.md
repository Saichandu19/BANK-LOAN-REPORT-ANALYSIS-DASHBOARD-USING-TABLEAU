# BANK LOAN REPORT ANALYSIS USING TABLEAU


"In this project, I developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report using Tableau Public, structured across three distinct dashboards—Summary, Overview, and Details. Each dashboard serves a specific purpose in analyzing and visualizing key loan-related metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making and performance monitoring.
# 1. Summary Dashboard:
-**Purpose**: This dashboard provides an overview of the bank’s loan performance using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income Ratio.
-**Details**:
The KPIs are segmented by Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes to help track the bank’s performance over time.
The dashboard also categorizes loans into 'Good Loans' (fully paid or current) and 'Bad Loans' (charged off), enabling a clear evaluation of loan quality.
